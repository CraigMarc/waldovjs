# Find Waldo Wenda and Wizard

This is the repo for a Where's Waldo game where you search through Where's Waldo pics and find Waldo Wenda and Wizard.  The site is built with vanilla js and uses Webpack.  It has a Node Js backend to check the coordinates of where the user clicks on the pic and also to save the user that has the fastest time to a MongoDb database.

The repo is live [here](https://subtle-daifuku-4bb302.netlify.app/)

The repo for the API is here (https://github.com/CraigMarc/waldo-api)
